# A very ILteresting Celeste Mod
Yeah, a mod in pure IL, just as a proof of concept.

## What does it do?
It has a simple module and an entity which allows infinite dashing in there.
Its not much, i know, but IL is hard D:

## Building
Requires `ildasm` from mono under linux.

Just run the `buildil` script and you are good to go.

If you are on windows, somehow adapt the script to whatever cli interface windows uses.

## Disclaimer
Yeah, theres lua code in here, but that's for the loenn plugin, just ignore it.
